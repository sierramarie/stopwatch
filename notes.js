HOMEWORK()

really we'/'re just making a timer and colin is telling us how a typical timer works...

start. start. 
pause. resume. numbers stop 
resume. numbers count again.

-double click resets timer 00:00:00

logic & set intervals and settimeouts 
use clear interval to 'pause' then schedule a new one to pick up where left of when resuming
